# Online Bookstore Project
This project simulates the operation of an online bookstore. It is implemented in JavaScript and uses object-oriented programming.

## Functionalities
The project allows users to [search for books](#classes), [add them to their carts](#cart-class), and [place orders](#order-class). It demonstrates the interaction between different classes and the overall functionality of the program.

To use this project, you can instantiate objects from the [User](#user-class), [Book](#book-class), [Cart](#cart-class), and [Order](#order-class) classes. You can then use the methods of these objects to simulate the functionality of an online bookstore.

## Classes
The project consists of the following classes:

### User Class
The User class represents the users of the bookstore. Each user has a name, age, phone number, email, and a unique user ID.

```JavaScript
// Importing the User class
const User = require("./classes/User");
```

The User instance expects to receive a name, age, phone number, and a valid email as parameters.

```JavaScript
// Creating a user
const user1 = new User('John Doe', 25, '1234567890', 'john@example.com');
```

### Book Class
The Book class represents individual books. Each book has a title, author, description, ISBN, price, and availability.

```JavaScript
// Importing the Book class
const Book = require("./classes/Book");
```

The Book instance expects to receive a title, author, description, ISBN, price, category, and availability as parameters.

```JavaScript
// Creating a book
const book1 = new Book('A Brief History of Time', 'Stephen Hawking', 'Guide to cosmology', '9780553380163', 18.00, 'Non-fiction', true);
```

### Cart Class
The Cart class simulates a shopping cart. It has methods to add books, remove books, and calculate the total price of the books in the cart.

```JavaScript
// Importing the Cart class 
const Cart = require("./classes/Cart");
```

The Cart instance expects to receive a user as a parameter. You can use the addItem method to add items to the cart.

```JavaScript
// Creating a cart
const cart1 = new Cart(user1)

// Adding books to the cart
cart1.addItem(book1, 2)

// Cart output in console
Cart {
  user: User {
    _id: 53711,
    _name: 'John Doe',
    _age: 25,
    _phone: '123456789',
    _email: 'john@mail.com'
  },
  items: [
    { book: [Book], quantity: 2 }
  ]
}
```

### Order Class
The Order class represents a userâ€™s order. It includes information about the user, the ordered books, the total price, the order date, and an order number.

```JavaScript
// Importing the Order class
const Order = require("./classes/Order");
```

The Order instance expects to receive a cart as a parameter.

```JavaScript
const order1 = new Order(cart1)

// Order output in console
Order {
  _user: User {
    _id: 443052,
    _name: 'John Doe',
    _age: 25,
    _phone: '123456789',
    _email: 'john@mail.com'
  },
  _items: [
    { book: [Book], quantity: 2 }
  ],
  _totalPrice: 36.00,
  _orderDate: 2024-05-07T23:15:56.800Z,
  _orderNumber: 71453
}
```
